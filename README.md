# MobilePayAlerts

#### Requirements:
Required modules:
* requests
* wxPython
* asyncio
* websockets
* pathlib

All can be installed like this: `pip install requests wxPython asyncio websockets pathlib`  
Or you can install one at a time if you prefer that.

#### Information:
The graphical user interface (GUI) is getting an overhaul because I'm switching to PyQt.    
You see the progress and follow the development here on GitHub or on the roadmap here: [Trello Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/j8OdYQ3O)
